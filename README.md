## Assignment Challenges

This homework was not as difficult as last week's but the most difficult part about this project was trying to learn how to use moment.js. The documentation was not as clear and also quite long. I mainly used Google to assist with how to use the moment() function correctly, how to pull certain information, and how its formatted. I fellow classmate suggested to use Youtube as well to learn moment.js.

## Take Aways

This homework made me realise that there will be times a client or a project will require something i've never done before and it is up to me to learn it as soon as possible and implement it correctly. This was just it with moment.js.
